## World Weather Research
This goal of this project was to gain experience acquiring data using APIs,  using the data to create data frames, and create different map figures using google map tools.
We acquired weather information for hundreds of cities near randomly generated sets of latitude and longitude coordinates. Using the different weather characteristics like max and min temp, cloudiness, humidity we generated linear regression charts to relate these characteristics to the latitude of the cities. 
We also created heat maps using google libraries that showed temperature with circles of different colors. We plotted out an itenirary map that included the route from city to city on a trip.
